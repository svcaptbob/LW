Manual Visualization:
I can give you a detailed description of the graph, similar to what I offered earlier. 
This would include listing each prime number (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 
47, 53, 59, 61, and 67) along with its corresponding frequency 
(number of times it appeared as a winning number) during the past three months.
